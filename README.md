# TelegramChatGuard

Ever had problems with [nickname abusers](https://imgur.com/a/UyFezlT) on your Telegram chat group? Well I had, therefore I created this bot. The bot kicks users whose nicknames are longer than defined maximum on join and cleans the spam messages (user join/leave message), simple.

Works with [Telegram Bots API Java Library](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots).

## Background

Back in times when I created this bot, Telegram had almost no limits for users nicknames length and all it took for a spammer to do his job was just join the group and leave right after that, leaving very nasty messages in chat. Now, I believe that Telegram introduced some limits but still someone may find the bot useful.
